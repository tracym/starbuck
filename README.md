# starbuck

A library of mostly broken clojure functions I once used to perform tabular data manipulations. 
Apologies for ill-documented code pulled from a more ambitious personal project that I only vaguely remember.

## TODO
* Write some tests
* Move more data manipulation functions I have lying around into this repo
