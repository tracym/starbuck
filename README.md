# starbuck

A library of clojure functions I used to perform tabular data manipulations. Comes in handy for merging csv files
with database data. Apologies for ill-documented code pulled from a more ambitious personal 
project that I only vaguely remember.

## Installation

Add this `:dependency` to your Leiningen
`project.clj`:

```clojure
[starbuck "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]

## TODO
* Write some tests
* Add support for excel directly instead of relying soley on csv files
* Move more data manipulation functions I have lying around into this repo
